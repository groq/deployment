# Docker Setup for Ubuntu 22.04 and GroqWare Developer Package

For those that would like to install the GroqWare Developer package in a docker container, weâ€™ve provided a Dockerfile and some instructions.

## Prerequisites

* Docker Installed and Running on an x86_64 host. See the [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) page for more information.

* Dockerfile included in [this folder](../docker/).

* GroqWare Developer Package for Ubuntu 22.04 (groq-devtools-ubuntu22.04-amd64-0.9.3.deb).

# Build Docker and Run

Ensure you have the GroqWare debian package in the same location as the provided Dockerfile, then build your docker image:

`docker build -t groq-devel .`

From time to time you may wish to rebuild without caching using the `--no-cache` flag so your docker image is built with the most recent git repo updates.  However, you may wish to save time by first check if any updates are available by running `git pull` from the desired git repo in your docker container before building without caching.

Run the image in interactive mode:

`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8439:8439 -p 8888:8888 groq-devel`

The above ports forwarded between the container and host correspond to the following:
* Port 8080 - Netron
* Port 8439 - GroqView
* Port 8888 - Jupyter
